# React App Project Folder Structure
This project contains folder structure for starting a react-app

# Note

This folder structure is mainly focused in the `src` folder of `create-react-app`

# Disclaimer
This folder structure that I build is based on the team I'm working on with as a ReactJS Dev plus my own preference as a full stack developer if I will work on a project in solo.

You can customize the folder structure or give me recommendation that can improved this sample folder structure that I build.
